# Hello, and welcome!

I'm Racoon, the alter ego of a senior software engineer based in Barcelona, Spain working in consultancy. I've worked in backend systems for over 6 years, from very simple text analysis, market research to big tech e-commerce. The reason I made this account is to document my learning process regarding new technologies I'm forced to learn like Python and Vue.
